## Access and Permission

### Location permission
You can choose if Syncthing-Fork is allowed to use Android's "location" permission. This is completely optional and not required to use the app. If the "location" permission is granted explicitly by the user, the app reads the current active WiFi connections SSID ("the WiFi network name") to give the user the benefit of performing file synchronization only on user-selected WiFi networks. It will save configured WiFi network names to the local phone's private app data storage to provide persistent configuration options for the user-configurable run conditions. The app will never determine or track the user's location.


## Information Collection and Use
**The developer of the Syncthing-Fork Wrapper doesn't have access to or gather any form of data from users of the application.** "data" for example refers to personal data, configuration files, unique IDs, files synchronized by Syncthing. As the Syncthing-Fork Android app is a wrapper and graphical user interface for Syncthing, it contains and uses the "third party" Syncthing module built from the official source code at [https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases). Syncthing as the "synchronization functionality core" may gather data from users, for example, it generates unique ID's for usage reporting and it may upload usage reports.
