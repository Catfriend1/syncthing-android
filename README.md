A wrapper of [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) for Android. Head to the "releases" section or F-Droid for builds. I'm currently short on time. Please seek help on the forum and/or social media apps first before consuming my time moderating issues on the tracker here. Please keep in mind that Syncthing-Fork was born as a personal interest of mine to help my family and friends use Syncthing on Android. It was not targeted at the currently more than 100.000 users even though I share my results with the community. Thank you.

## I am no longer publishing this on Google Play

See [detailed info](wiki/Switch-between-releases_Verify-APK-is-genuine.md) about release variants and which is recommended to fit your needs.

"nel0x" has announced to continue publishing on the play store. I welcome his help and the work I think he'll put into [his mission](https://github.com/nel0x/syncthing-android-gplay). It's up to you, reading this, to decide if to trust and/or support him or go with the F-Droid release channel of this app instead. You don't know me and I don't know him... we are all volunteers in the spirit of open source.
