This is a fork of the Syncthing-Android wrapper for Syncthing that brings major enhancements like:
* 每台设备和每个同步文件夹均可设置单独的同步规则
*最近的更改显示在UI上，单击以打开文件。
*高功耗是固定的。
* 支持 Android 8 和 9

Syncthing-Fork for Android is a wrapper for Syncthing that provides an Android UI instead of Syncthing's built-in Web UI. Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open, trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's transmitted over the Internet.

Goals of the fork:
* Develop and try out enhancements together with the community.
* Release the wrapper more frequently to identify and fix bugs caused by changes in the syncthing submodule
* Make enhancements configurable in the UI, users should be able to turn them on and off

Comparison between upstream and fork at the time of writing this:
* Both contain the syncthing binary built from the official source at GitHub:syncthing/syncthing
* Syncing functionality and reliability depends on the syncthing binary submodule version.
* Fork gets along with upstream and sometimes they pick up my improvements.
* Strategy and release frequency is different
* Only the wrapper containing the Android UI is addressed by the fork.
