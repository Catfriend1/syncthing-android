⚠️ Breaking change:
The config import and export feature now reads or writes the file "(InternalStorage)/backups/syncthing/config.zip". This file can be encrypted by a user-defined password to protect sensitive parts of your Syncthing configuration like, for example, device trust and which data you share with other devices. The change makes it harder for a bad actor to gain unauthorized access to your files using stolen config exports.

ℹ️ Action required:
- Please go to "Settings - Import and Export"
- Set an individual password, be sure to remember it
- Click "Export Configuration" and confirm
- Open your file manager, e.g. Material Files
- Browse to "(InternalStorage)/backups/syncthing"
- Delete all "*.pem", "*.xml" files because they contain an outdated and unencrypted config from prior exports.
