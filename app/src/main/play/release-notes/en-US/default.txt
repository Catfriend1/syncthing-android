Upgrade notes:
The backup folder location UI preference on the settings screen is now relative to the internal storage root. Before, it was interpreted relative to the "(int-stor)/backups" folder. Please review that setting if you upgrade from a previous release.

Notes:
We will now prefer CI builds over builds done on a personal device.
Debug APK signing was upgraded from SHA1 to SHA256 signing.
We are preparing for GPG signed release artifacts.

Changes:
Update SyncthingNative to v1.29.6
