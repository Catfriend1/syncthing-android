## Syncthing-Fork v1.29.7.2 (2025-06-04)

‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change:
The config import and export feature now reads or writes the file "(InternalStorage)/backups/syncthing/config.zip". This file can be encrypted by a user-defined password to protect sensitive parts of your Syncthing configuration like, for example, device trust and which data you share with other devices. The change makes it harder for a bad actor to gain unauthorized access to your files using stolen config exports.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Action required:
- Please go to "Settings - Import and Export"
- Set an individual password, be sure to remember it
- Click "Export Configuration" and confirm
- Open your file manager, e.g. Material Files
- Browse to "(InternalStorage)/backups/syncthing"
- Delete all ".pem", ".xml" files because they contain an outdated and unencrypted config from prior exports.

‚ö°If you'd like to import an old and unencrypted config consisting of multiple files instead of the zip archive, please follow [these steps](migration/Switching-from-the-deprecated-official-version.md).
