AutoName: Syncthing-Fork (Catfriend1)
Summary: File synchronization
Description: |-
    This is a fork of [[com.nutomic.syncthingandroid]] that brings major
    enhancements like:
    * UI explains why syncthing is running or not running according to the run
    conditions set in preferences.
    * A welcome wizard guiding you through initial setup on first launch or if
    mandatory prerequisites are missing like for example the storage permission.
    * Run condition bugs are fixed.
    * "Battery eater" problem is fixed.
    * Android 8+ support is on it's way.
    Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open,
    trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to
    choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's
    transmitted over the Internet.
